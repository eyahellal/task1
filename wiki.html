     <h2><strong>lake takapo:</strong></h2></font>
    <p><i> One of those serene, otherworldly places, Lake Tekapo is a beautiful small town perched on the southern end of a glacial lake.<br> With fields of the famous purple and pink Lupin flowers,<br> views of the Southern Alps and some seriously blue waters,<br> this is a beautiful place for your bucket list.
        The Church of the Good Shepard on the outskirts of Tekapo is one of the most picturesque spots and is a perfect place to watch the night’s sky.<br> In fact, the whole town is a star-gazing dream, especially at the Mt.<br> John Observatory, where you can see the Southern Lights (Aurora Australis).

Visitors can explore caves, crevasses and more on guided ice walks or heli-hikes.<br> It’s pretty cool, if you’ll pardon the pun.</i> </p>
